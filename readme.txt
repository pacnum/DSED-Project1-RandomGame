How to Play

This is a simple Russian Roulette game.
The aim of this game is to load the gun and fire.
If you shoot yourself, you lose, if you shoot with the protective jacket on – you win.
There is 1 bullet, in one of 6 chambers, with 2 chances to wear the protective jacket


Step 1
Load the Gun by clicking the Load Button
 
Step 2
Choose if you want to wear the protective jacket
If you do wish to wear the jacket, click the button, and then fire the gun.
(you have 2 chances to wear the jacket)
If you choose not to wear the jacket, fire the gun and hope the bullet is NOT in the chamber.
If you win or lose, you can play again by clicking the play again button.


The Win and Loss totals are shown at the top of the screen.

A help page is available in the game to show these rules.
